# ✈️ SkyOpsHub

**SkyOpsHub** is an AI-powered airline operations management platform designed to streamline, optimize, and automate complex airline operational workflows. It helps airlines reduce operational chaos, improve on-time performance, and ensure regulatory compliance through intelligent decision-making and real-time insights.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

Airline operations involve highly complex, interdependent systems—flight scheduling, crew assignments, aircraft availability, maintenance planning, and regulatory constraints. Manual coordination or legacy tools often lead to inefficiencies, delays, and increased costs.

**SkyOpsHub aims to become a unified operational command center for airlines**, leveraging AI and automation to:
- Optimize daily operations
- Reduce disruptions and delays
- Ensure safety and compliance
- Improve operational transparency and decision-making

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

SkyOpsHub acts as a **centralized SaaS platform** that integrates operational data from multiple airline systems and applies intelligent optimization models to assist operations teams in planning, monitoring, and responding to real-world scenarios.

Rather than replacing human decision-makers, SkyOpsHub **augments operational teams** by providing smart recommendations, conflict detection, and real-time visibility.
